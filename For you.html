<h1 class="text-big"> Core group outing 1</h1>
<p class="text-small">
This was the first time we went with our core and most special group. It was so much fun going out with the group which was always with us when we needed them the most. I was so lucky to get them because of you. We had so much fun with them. First we had lunch in the house of Makeba, we clicked photos and then we went to fun blast but waiting was too much so we decided to go shott but unfortunately there was 2-3 hours waiting. Then finally we decided to go ice cream place called huber and holly and there we enjoyed other most precious time. It was so special for me to enjoy with you and with everybody.

<h1 class="text-big"> Riverfront Time </h1>
<p class="text-small">
Our best time was when we 5 were there in Riverfront. We have been in riverfront before but we were there with our college friends but with our core group we enjoyed a lot. We did cycling, Rhoda timepass, photo session and lot of pagalpanti. After that we went to IIM to eat South Indian but unfortunately we have to come back without eating due to some family calls from our parents. But nonetheless we enjoyed a lot. This was the best photo we ever had, agree?

<h1 class="text-big"> Its time for some monologue</h1>
<p class="text-small">
Thank you for everything you have done for me and you will do for me.
Thankyou you for being my bestfriend and most importantly my sister you guides me what to do and what not to do
Wo alag baat hai ki me sunta nahi hu teri Jo mujhe Sunni chaiye tujhse milne se phele mujhe yehi lagta tha ki me kya apne problems sabko batau apni feelings sabko batau but tujhse milne ke baad malum pada ki problems share karni chaiye unse to karni chaiye jo apke bare me sochte hai
Tune mere lie bohot kia hai me count bhi nahi Kara sakta 
Mere life me esa koi nahi tha jisne mere sath raatko 2-3 Baje bhi baat karke mujhe shaant kia ho
Me depression me tha anxiety attacks aate the sirf tujhe malum pada mujhe dekhe aur tune mujhe sambhala thank you 
Me itna expressive nahi tha me kya soch raha hu koi pata nahi kar sakta tha but tu alag hai
Teko sab malum pad jata hai mera face dekhe ke teko milne ke baad me expressive ho gaya hu feelings share karne laga hu jo mere maan me hota hai vo bolne laga hu, jaatane laga hu that's a good thing for me
Me tere bina function kar sakta hu ya nahi mujhe malum nahi but mujhe shayad nahi karna. Just be with me forever be my sister be my mentor and most importantly be my bestfriend. Tu meri behen thi hai aur humesa rahegi. Me tera bada bhai hu teko teri mistake par publicly to sath duga but akele me teko daatuga aur samjhauga
Aur teko kabhi kabhi meri help chahiye ho you know how to contact me 
Mene dosti time dekhe nahi ki thi to me help bhi time dekheke nahi karts bhale vo raatke 2baje ho ya 3baje 
Best friend start with b but for me it starts with t.
Comfort starts with c but for me it starts with t.
You are my comfort zone i know whenever I feel low and need someone you were there for me and i know you will always be there for me
Just remember i will always be there for no matter what agar me dusri state me hu dusre country me 
I will always love you.
